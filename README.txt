Movie Website README File:

The purpose of this application is to demonstrate the skills in Python and in computer programming, more broadly, which I have learned in the Programming Foundations with Python course. Most of the code contained within accompanying files contains code that was presented in course demonstrations. However, every keystroke of the contained files was mine with the exception of the fresh_tomatoes.py file. I did however update the Bootstrap and JQuery versions as well as made some stylistic changes. Thanks for the help. I hope I did well.

TO RUN:

To run the application, simply open the entertainment_center.py file in IDLE and run the module.
